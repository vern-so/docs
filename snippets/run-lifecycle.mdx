A run goes through the following states during its lifecycle:

- `queued`: Initial state when the run is created
- `running`: The task is actively being executed
- `complete`: Task execution finished successfully
- `failed`: Task execution encountered an error

The current state can be retrieved through the API or SDK using the run's ID.
