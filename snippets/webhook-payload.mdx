When a webhook event occurs, Vern sends a payload with the following structure based on the event type:

<CodeGroup>

```json run.completed
{
  "id": "run_123",
  "task": "taskName",
  "inputs": {
    // Your provided inputs
  },
  "response": {
    // Task execution results
  },
  "status": "completed",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "started_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:01Z",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:02Z"
}
```

```json profile.linked
{
  "email": "youruser@microsoft.com",
  "integration": "LinkedIn",
  "linked_at": "2025-05-29 05:02:59.288+00",
  "uid": "example-user-123"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone.
