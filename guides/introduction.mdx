Welcome to Vern! Vern helps you create browser agents that can automate tasks on websites. To get started, it's helpful to understand two key concepts:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tasks" icon="clipboard-list" href="/guides/essentials/tasks">
    Define specific actions or workflows Vern can perform within a browser. Set
    up tasks via the Vern UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runs" icon="play" href="/guides/essentials/runs">
    Execute a specific Task. Trigger runs via the API or SDK using a Task ID.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it Fits Together

1.  You define **Tasks** that Vern can perform (e.g., "Search for Properties", "Fill Out Forms", "Extract Data") in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/tasks).
2.  You trigger a **Run** via the API or SDK using the **Task ID** for the action you want to perform, along with any required inputs.
3.  Vern executes the task in a browser and returns the results to you.
