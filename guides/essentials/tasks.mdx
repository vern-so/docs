Tasks represent specific, reusable actions or workflows that Vern can perform within a browser. They define _what_ Vern should do when triggered.

## Purpose of Tasks

- **Action Definition:** Encapsulate a specific operation, like "Search for Products", "Fill Out Forms", "Extract Data", or "Complete Checkout".
- **Input and Response Specification:** Define the data (inputs) required to execute the action and what data to return (responses).
- **Reusability:** Define a task once and trigger it multiple times with different inputs.

## Creating Tasks

Tasks are configured within the Vern user interface:

1. Navigate to the **Tasks** section in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/tasks).
2. Click **"New Task"**.
3. Define the task logic:

   **Task Studio (Beta):**
   - Record your actions as you navigate websites and interact with elements
   - Review and edit the generated Task
   
   **Manual:**
   - Enter target URLs and navigation instructions
   - Define input parameters and their mappings
   - Specify element interactions and wait conditions
   - Configure output data extraction and response format

      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}

    allowFullScreen={true}
    allowTransparency={false}
  />
</div>

## Task Execution

When a task is executed through a [Run](/guides/essentials/runs), it:

1. Validates the provided inputs
2. Initializes the browser environment
3. Executes the defined workflow
4. Captures and returns the results

The execution is asynchronous, and you can monitor progress through run status updates.

## Best Practices
- Define clear input requirements
- Set appropriate default values
- Include input descriptions

## Next Steps

Once you've created a task, you can execute it by creating [Runs](/guides/essentials/runs) through our API or SDK. Refer to the API reference for detailed information about task execution and management.
