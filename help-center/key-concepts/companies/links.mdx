<Info>
  **Recommended:** Set up [Templates](/help-center/key-concepts/curator/templates) before creating your link. Templates define what data you need to collect from your customer and help you validate and clean their data automatically when they submit it.
</Info>

Links give your customers a simple, secure way to share their information during onboarding. Everything flows into one place where you can track progress and validate data.

## What Are Companies?

Companies help you track each customer's onboarding project. Manage all your companies at [vern.so/companies](https://vern.so/companies). Each company represents a customer and keeps all their data organized in one place.

## How Links Work

When you create a company, Vern automatically generates a unique link. Your customers can use it to:

- **Upload CSV files** - Manually upload spreadsheets and data exports
- **Complete forms** - Fill out structured forms you've created
- **Authenticate Scouts** - Grant permission for Scouts (our AI web agents) to scrape data and files on their behalf

For example, when onboarding a new HR client, you create a company and send them the link. They can upload their employee roster CSV, fill out a form about their benefits structure, and authenticate a Scout to pull payroll data from their existing system—all through one link. Everything comes together in your dashboard where you can track validation progress.

## Getting Started

Creating a link is simple—just create a company and the link is generated automatically. Share it with your customer via email, Slack, or your platform. They can access it immediately and start sharing their data.

You can refresh links at any time for security. The old link will no longer work, ensuring your customer's data remains secure.

## How Customers Use Links

Your customers will appreciate how straightforward the process is. For a construction company onboarding, they can use the link to upload their project list, complete a form about their equipment inventory, and allow a Scout to extract data from their project management tool. Instead of sending multiple emails with attachments, they have one place to go where everything is clearly organized.

All submissions are automatically captured and stored with their company data in one centralized location, making it easy to track what's been submitted and what needs validation.
