Chat lets you use our AI Curator to perform bulk data transformations with simple, natural language instructions. Instead of manually fixing data column by column, you can tell the AI what you need and it handles the work automatically.

## What Is Chat?

Chat is your AI assistant for cleaning and transforming data. Give it simple instructions like "Fix date of birth column" or "Extract medication values from the notes column," and it uses the column descriptions and rules from your Templates to make the changes automatically.

## How Chat Works

When you use Chat, the AI understands the context of your data through your Templates. It knows what each column should contain based on the descriptions and validation rules you've set up, so it can make intelligent fixes.

For example, if you have a date of birth column that's messy—some dates are in different formats, some have typos—you can simply tell Chat to "Fix date of birth column." The AI will use the column's description and rules to standardize all the dates correctly.

## Extracting Hidden Values

One powerful feature of Chat is its ability to extract values that are hidden within other columns. For example, if you have a notes column that contains medication information mixed with other text, you can tell Chat to "Extract medication values from the notes column," and it will pull out just the medication information into a new column.

This is especially useful when customers submit data in free-form text fields. For HR software, you might extract department names from an "Additional Notes" column. For construction software, you might extract equipment serial numbers from a "Project Notes" field.

## Bulk Transformations

Chat excels at handling bulk transformations across entire columns. Instead of fixing data row by row, you can transform thousands of records at once with a single instruction. The AI understands your Templates, so it knows how to format data correctly according to your rules.

## Example Use Cases

For HR software, you might use Chat to:
- "Fix all employee ID formats"
- "Extract emergency contact phone numbers from the notes column"
- "Standardize department names"

For construction software, you might use Chat to:
- "Extract project start dates from the description field"
- "Fix equipment serial number formats"
- "Extract manager names from the project notes column"

Chat makes it easy to clean messy customer data quickly, so you can focus on getting them onboarded instead of spending hours fixing formatting issues.
