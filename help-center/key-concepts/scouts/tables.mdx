Tables let you run several Scouts at the same time for a given Task. Instead of extracting one item at a time, Tables automatically find all matching records and extract them all at once.

<Info>
  **Important:** Before running an extraction, your customer must have signed in and authorized Scouts via a [Link](/help-center/key-concepts/companies/links). The Link allows Scouts to access and extract data on their behalf.

## What Are Tables?

Tables are a simple way to run multiple Scouts simultaneously for the same Task. When you need to extract multiple records of the same type, Tables handle the work automatically—finding all the records, identifying their properties, and extracting everything in one go.

## How Tables Work

When you run a Task in a Table, the system automatically:
- Finds the number of records (e.g., 52 Projects)
- Identifies their unique identifiers (e.g., Project Name)
- Extracts all their properties (e.g., Name, Address, Manager, Duration)
- Collects everything into a structured table format

## Example: Extracting All Projects

Let's say you want to extract all Projects for a customer. You would:
1. Create a Task that tells the Scout to "Navigate to project, extract all the details on the project info tab"
2. Run that Task in a Table

The Table will automatically find all Projects on the page, identify each one by its Project Name, and extract all the details (Name, Address, Manager, Duration, etc.) for all 52 Projects—without you having to manually go through each one.

## When to Use Tables vs Single Runs

Use **Tables** when you need to extract multiple records of the same type. Tables are perfect for:
- Extracting all Projects from a project management system
- Collecting all Employees from an HR system
- Gathering all Orders from an e-commerce platform
- Any scenario where you need many records with the same structure

Use **single Runs** when you only need one specific item or report. Single Runs are better for:
- Extracting a single document
- Getting data from one specific page
- Quick, one-time extractions

## Benefits of Tables

Tables save you significant time by automating the process of finding and extracting multiple records. Instead of manually clicking through each Project or Employee entry, Tables do it all automatically and organize everything into a clean, structured format that's ready to use.
