## Quick Start: Using @ to Reference Columns

**The easiest way to tell the assistant which columns to work with is to type `@` followed by the column name.**

When you type `@`, you'll see a list of all your columns. Just click on the one you want, or hit enter.

## Common Tasks & Examples

### 1. Fixing Format Issues

**When to use:** Your data has inconsistent formatting, extra characters, or needs to match a specific pattern.

**Examples:**

- `Fix the format of @Phone Number`
- `Remove all dashes from @NRIC`
- `Add dashes to @Phone Number to match the format XXX-XXX-XXXX`
- `Standardize @Email addresses`
- `Clean up @Address - remove extra spaces`
- `Make @Date of Birth all the same format`

**What happens:** The assistant will make all values in that column follow the same format, removing inconsistencies while keeping your data intact.

### 2. Combining Columns

**When to use:** You want to merge two or more columns into one (like combining First Name and Last Name into Full Name).

**Examples:**

- `Combine @First Name and @Last Name into @Full Name`
- `Join @Street, @City, and @State into @Full Address`
- `Merge @Area Code and @Phone Number into @Complete Phone`

**What happens:** The assistant creates a new column (or fills an existing one) with the combined values, using a space or comma as a separator.

### 3. Splitting Columns

**When to use:** One column contains multiple pieces of information that should be separate (like "John Smith" that should be "John" and "Smith").

**Examples:**

- `Split @Full Name into @First Name and @Last Name`
- `Separate @Full Address into @Street, @City, and @Zip Code`
- `Break apart @Product Code into @Category and @Item Number`

**What happens:** The assistant splits the values and puts them into the columns you specify.

### 4. Calculating Values

**When to use:** You need to do math with your data (multiply, add, subtract, divide).

**Examples:**

- `Calculate @Total by multiplying @Hours times @Rate`
- `Add @Base Salary and @Bonus to get @Total Compensation`
- `Calculate @Discount Price as @Original Price minus @Discount Amount`
- `Multiply @Quantity by @Unit Price to fill @Line Total`

**What happens:** The assistant performs the calculation for each row and fills in the result.

### 5. Working with Dates

**When to use:** You need to calculate ages, add/subtract days, or fill in today's date.

**Examples:**

- `Calculate age from @Date of Birth and put it in @Age`
- `Add 30 days to @Start Date and fill @End Date`
- `Fill @Today's Date with today's date`
- `Calculate how many days until @Due Date`
- `Add 1 year to @Hire Date`

**What happens:** The assistant performs the date calculation automatically.

### 6. Looking Up Values from Other Sheets

**When to use:** You have data in one sheet and need to find matching information from another sheet (like looking up a product price based on a product ID).

**Examples:**

- `Match @Payroll ID (Budgets) to @payrollid (Payroll) and copy @frequency (Payroll) into @Frequency (Budgets)`
- `Look up @price (Products) using @product_id (Orders) and fill @unit_price (Orders)`
- `Find @name (Departments) based on @department_id (Employees) and put it in @department_name (Employees)`
- `Match @role (Employees) and @level (Employees) to get @salary (Pay Rates)`

**What happens:** The assistant finds matching rows between sheets and copies the values you need.

For more detailed examples of cross-sheet operations, see [Calculate values across sheets](/help-center/guides/calculate-values-across-sheets).

### 7. Extracting Information

**When to use:** You have a column with free text (like notes or descriptions) and want to pull out specific information.

**Examples:**

- `Extract allergy information from @Notes and put it in @Allergies`
- `Pull out phone numbers from @Description into @Contact Phone`
- `Find email addresses in @Comments and extract them to @Email`

**What happens:** The assistant reads through the text and extracts the relevant information into a new column.

### 8. Categorizing or Classifying Data

**When to use:** You want to automatically group or categorize your data based on patterns.

**Examples:**

- `Classify @Job Title into @Department (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, etc.)`
- `Categorize @Product Description into @Product Type`
- `Determine @Priority Level from @Issue Description`

**What happens:** The assistant analyzes your data and assigns categories based on what it finds.

### 9. Converting Formats

**When to use:** You need to change data from one format to another (like dates, currencies, or units).

**Examples:**

- `Convert @Date from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format`
- `Convert @Amount from USD to EUR using @rate (Exchange Rates)`
- `Change @Temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius`

**What happens:** The assistant converts all values to the new format you specify.

### 10. Formatting Text

**When to use:** You want to change how text looks (capitalization, padding, trimming).

**Examples:**

- `Capitalize the first letter of each word in @Full Name`
- `Make @Email all lowercase`
- `Add leading zeros to @Order Number so it's always 5 digits`
- `Remove extra spaces from @Address`

**What happens:** The assistant applies the formatting you request to all values in the column.

### 11. Deleting or Clearing Data

**When to use:** You want to remove values from a column (either all values or specific ones).

**Examples:**

- `Delete all values in @Notes`
- `Clear @Status column`
- `Remove all data from @Temporary Column`
- `Delete values in @Comments where @Status is "Inactive"`

**What happens:** The assistant removes the values you specify, leaving those cells empty.

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific

✅ **Good:** `Fix the format of @Phone Number to include dashes`

❌ **Vague:** `Fix phone numbers`

### Use Column References

✅ **Good:** `Combine @First Name and @Last Name into @Full Name`

❌ **Less clear:** `Combine first and last name`

### Mention Both Source and Target Columns

✅ **Good:** `Extract allergies from @Notes and put them in @Allergies`

❌ **Less clear:** `Extract allergies`

### For Cross-Sheet Operations, Use the (Sheet) Format

✅ **Good:** `Match @product_id (Orders) to @id (Products) and get @price (Products)`

❌ **Less clear:** `Get product prices`

### Use Templates for Better Results

Make sure your [Workbook](/help-center/key-concepts/curator/workbooks) sheets have [Templates](/help-center/key-concepts/curator/templates) assigned. Chat uses Template descriptions and validation rules to better understand your data and provide more accurate suggestions.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fix Formatting

**Template:** `Fix [what's wrong] in @Column Name`

- `Fix the date format in @Birth Date`
- `Fix phone numbers in @Contact`
- `Fix email addresses in @Email`

### Pattern 2: Combine Information

**Template:** `Combine @Column1 and @Column2 into @Target Column`

- `Combine @First and @Last into @Full Name`
- `Join @Street, @City, @State into @Address`

### Pattern 3: Split Information

**Template:** `Split @Source Column into @Column1 and @Column2`

- `Split @Full Name into @First Name and @Last Name`
- `Separate @Address into @Street, @City, @Zip`

### Pattern 4: Calculate

**Template:** `Calculate @Result by [operation] @Column1 [operator] @Column2`

- `Calculate @Total by multiplying @Quantity times @Price`
- `Add @Base and @Bonus to get @Total`

### Pattern 5: Look Up

**Template:** `Match @Key (Sheet1) to @Key (Sheet2) and get @Value (Sheet2)`

- `Match @product_id (Orders) to @id (Products) and get @price (Products)`

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

If the assistant doesn't understand your request:

1. **Be more specific** - Add more details about what you want
2. **Use column references** - Type `@` and select the exact columns
3. **Break it into steps** - Try doing one thing at a time
4. **Check your column names** - Make sure the columns you're referencing actually exist

The assistant will ask you questions if it needs clarification, especially when there are multiple ways to handle your request.

## Need Help?

If you're not sure how to phrase something, try:

- Describing what you want in plain English
- Mentioning the column names using `@`
- Being specific about the result you want

The assistant is designed to understand natural language, so don't worry about using perfect grammar or technical terms!
