## Quick Start: Using @ to Reference Columns

**The easiest way to tell the assistant which columns to work with is to type `@` followed by the column name.**

When you type `@` and start typing a column name, you'll see a list of matching columns in the workbook (from the current *and* other sheets). Just click on the one you want, or hit enter to add it to the AI’s context.



## Common Tasks & Examples

### 1. Fixing Format Issues

**When to use:** Your data has inconsistent formatting, extra characters, or needs to match a specific pattern.

**Examples:**

- `Fix the format of @Phone Number`
- `Remove all dashes from @NRIC`
- `Standardize @Email addresses`
- `Clean up @Address - remove extra spaces`
- `Make @Date of Birth all the same format`

**What happens:** The assistant will make all values in that column follow the same format, removing inconsistencies while keeping your data intact.

### 2. Combining Columns

**When to use:** You want to merge two or more columns into one (like combining First Name and Last Name into Full Name).

**Examples:**

- `Combine @First Name and @Last Name into @Full Name`
- `Join @Street, @City, and @State into @Full Address`
- `Merge @Area Code and @Phone Number into @Complete Phone`

**What happens:** The assistant fills the target column with the combined values, with a relevant separator.

### 3. Splitting Columns

**When to use:** One column contains multiple pieces of information that should be separate (like "John Smith" that should be "John" and "Smith").

**Example:**

- `Split @Full Name into @First Name and @Last Name`

**What happens:** The assistant splits the values and puts them into the columns you specify.

### 4. Calculating Values

**When to use:** You need to do math with your data (multiply, add, subtract, divide).

**Examples:**

- `Calculate @Total by multiplying @Hours times @Rate`
- `Add @Base Salary and @Bonus to get @Total Compensation`
- `Calculate @Discount Price as @Original Price minus @Discount Amount`
- `Multiply @Quantity by @Unit Price to fill @Line Total`

**What happens:** The assistant performs the calculation for each row and fills in the result.

### 5. Working with Dates

**When to use:** You need to calculate ages, add/subtract days, or fill in today's date.

**Example:**

- `Calculate age from @Date of Birth and put it in @Age`

**What happens:** The assistant performs the date calculation automatically.

### 6. Looking up values from other sheets

**When to use:**

You have data in one sheet and want to bring in related information from another sheet - for example, copying a price, status, or category based on a matching ID.

**How to reference columns:**

Type `@` and select a column from the list.

**Example prompt:**

- `Match @Payroll ID with @payrollId, then copy @frequency into @Frequency`

*(In the column picker, you’ll see which sheet each column belongs to)*

**What happens:**

The assistant matches rows across sheets using the columns you selected and copies the requested values into the target sheet.

For more examples of working across sheets, see [Calculate values across sheets](/help-center/guides/calculate-values-across-sheets).

### 7. Extracting Information

**When to use:** You have a column with free text (like notes or descriptions) and want to pull out specific information.

**Examples:**

- `Extract allergy information from @Notes and put it in @Allergies`
- `Pull out phone numbers from @Description into @Contact Phone`
- `Find email addresses in @Comments and extract them to @Email`

**What happens:** The assistant reads through the text and extracts the relevant information into a new column.

### 8. Categorizing or Classifying Data

**When to use:** You want to automatically group or categorize your data based on patterns.

**Examples:**

- `Classify @Job Title into @Department (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, etc.)`
- `Categorize @Product Description into @Product Type`
- `Determine @Priority Level from @Issue Description`

**What happens:** The assistant analyzes your data and assigns categories based on what it finds.

### 9. Converting Formats

**When to use:** You need to change data from one format to another (like dates, currencies, or units).

**Examples:**

- `Convert @Date from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format`
- `Convert @Amount from USD to EUR using @rate (Exchange Rates)`

**What happens:** The assistant converts all values to the new format you specify.

### 10. Formatting Text

**When to use:** You want to change how text looks (capitalization, padding, trimming).

**Example:**

- `Capitalize the first letter of each word in @Full Name`

**What happens:** The assistant applies the formatting you request to all values in the column.

### 11. Deleting or Clearing Data

**When to use:** You want to remove values from a column (either all values or specific ones).

**Examples:**

- `Delete all values in @Notes`
- `Clear @Status column`

**What happens:** The assistant removes the values you specify, leaving those cells empty.

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific

✅ **Good:** `Fix the format of @Phone Number to include dashes`

❌ **Vague:** `Fix phone numbers`

### Use Column References

✅ **Good:** `Combine @First Name and @Last Name into @Full Name`

❌ **Less clear:** `Combine first and last name`

### Mention Both Source and Target Columns

✅ **Good:** `Extract allergies from @Notes and put them in @Allergies`

❌ **Less clear:** `Extract allergies`

### Use Templates for Better Results

Make sure your [Workbook](/help-center/key-concepts/curator/workbooks) sheets have [Templates](/help-center/key-concepts/curator/templates) assigned. Chat uses Template descriptions and validation rules to better understand your data and provide more accurate suggestions.

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

If the assistant doesn't understand your request:

1. **Be more specific** - Add more details about what you want
2. **Use column references** - Type `@` and select the exact columns
3. **Break it into steps** - Try doing one thing at a time
4. **Check your column names** - Make sure the columns you're referencing actually exist

The assistant will ask you questions if it needs clarification, especially when there are multiple ways to handle your request.

## Need Help?

If you're not sure how to phrase something, try:

- Describing what you want in plain English
- Mentioning the column names using `@`
- Being specific about the result you want

The assistant is designed to understand natural language, so don't worry about using perfect grammar or technical terms!
