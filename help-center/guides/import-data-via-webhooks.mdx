Webhooks allow you to import data directly from your workbooks into your application in real-time. Once configured, you can export cleaned data from any workbook and have it automatically sent to your app's endpoint.

## Overview

When you export data from a workbook, Vern sends webhook events to your configured endpoint. This requires:

1. Setting up a webhook endpoint in the developer settings
2. Configuring your application to receive and process the webhook events
3. Exporting data from your workbook to trigger the webhook

## Setting up webhooks

To configure webhooks, navigate to **Developer Settings** → **Webhooks**. This will load the Svix portal, which is our webhook provider.

### Adding an endpoint

1. Click **Add Endpoint** in the Svix portal
2. Enter your endpoint URL (this should be provided by your developer)
   - For testing, you can use **Svix Play** to simulate an endpoint
3. Give your endpoint a descriptive name (e.g., "Production endpoint for ACME HR")
4. Subscribe to the **production export event** to receive data exports
5. Click **Create**

Once your endpoint is configured, you'll see an **Import to [Your Company Name]** option when viewing workbooks.

## Exporting data from workbooks

After setting up your webhook endpoint:

1. Open the workbook containing the data you want to import
2. Select the rows you want to export (or leave all selected for the entire dataset)
3. Click **Export Data**
4. Choose your configured endpoint (e.g., "Production" or "Preview")
5. The webhook event will be sent to your endpoint

You can verify the webhook was sent successfully by checking the Svix portal. In the endpoint details, you'll see:
- Successful message delivery
- The exact payload body
- Full logs of all webhook events

## Webhook payload structure

The webhook payload contains your exported data in batches. Here's what to expect:

- **Rows of data**: All the exported records from your workbook
- **Indexed rows**: Each row includes its index number (e.g., row 1 to 50)
- **Row order**: The original order of rows in the workbook is preserved
- **Errors**: Any errors attached to specific records are included
- **Batching**: Data is sent in batches of 1,000 records. If you have more than 1,000 records, multiple webhook events will be sent

## Event catalog

The Svix portal includes an **Event Catalog** that shows all available webhook events. For workbook data exports, you'll see:

- **Production export event**: The event type for exporting data to your production app
- **Preview export event**: The event type for exporting data to preview/test environments

You can view the exact structure of these events in the event catalog, which is helpful for your developers to understand how the data will arrive at your endpoint.

## Next steps

Once your webhook endpoint is configured and receiving events, your development team needs to:

1. Process the incoming webhook payloads
2. Extract the row data from each batch
3. Save the data to your database
4. Handle any errors attached to records
5. Implement proper error handling and retry logic for failed deliveries

The Svix portal provides detailed logs and message history, making it easy to debug and monitor your webhook integrations.
