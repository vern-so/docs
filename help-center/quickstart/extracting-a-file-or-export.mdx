title: Extract a file or export from your customer's old system

Sometimes your customer needs to extract a single document or report from their old system. Single Runs let you do this quickly using Scouts (our AI web agents).

## When to Use Single Runs

Use a single Run when you need to extract:
- One specific document or report
- Data from a single page or source
- A quick, one-time extraction

For example, if you need to extract a single Employees report from their HR system, a single Run is perfect for this.

## Step 1: Create a Task

First, you need to create a Task that tells the Scout what to do. Go to the Tasks section in your dashboard and click "New Task."

You can use Task Studio to record your actions as you navigate the website, or manually enter instructions like "Navigate to the reports page and download the Employee Export."

## Step 2: Create a Run

</Frame>

Once you have a Task, go to the Runs section and create a new Run. Select the Task you just created and provide any specific information needed—like the customer's login credentials or which report to download.

## Step 3: Monitor Progress

The Scout will start working immediately. You can watch the Run's progress in real-time. You'll see when it starts, when it's navigating the site, and when it completes.

## Step 4: Get Your Data

Once the Run completes, the extracted data is automatically available. You can optionally add it to a Workbook where you can validate and clean it.

## Need Multiple Records?

If you need to extract multiple records of the same type (like all Projects or all Employees), use [Tables instead](/help-center/quickstart/extracting-multiple-pages). Tables automatically handle extracting many records at once.

## Next Steps

After extracting the data, you can:
- [Validate it](/help-center/quickstart/validating-your-customers-data) using Templates
- [Clean it](/help-center/quickstart/cleaning-your-customers-messy-data) using Chat if needed
