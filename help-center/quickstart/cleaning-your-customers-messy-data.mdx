title: Clean your customer's messy data

import { Frame } from '@mintlify/components';

Even after validation, you might have messy data that needs cleaning—dates in different formats, typos, or values hidden in other columns. Chat makes it easy to fix these issues with simple instructions.

## Step 1: Open Your Workbook

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/%23workbook.png" alt="Workbooks interface" />
</Frame>

Go to your Workbooks and open the Workbook containing the data you want to clean. Make sure your sheet has a Template assigned—Chat uses the Template's descriptions and rules to understand how to fix your data.

## Step 2: Use Chat for Bulk Fixes

Click on the Chat feature in your Workbook. You can now give Chat simple instructions to fix your data.

## Common Cleaning Tasks

**Fix formatting issues:**
- "Fix date of birth column" - Standardizes all dates to the correct format
- "Fix employee ID formats" - Corrects formatting inconsistencies
- "Standardize department names" - Fixes typos and variations

**Extract hidden values:**
- "Extract medication values from the notes column" - Pulls out specific information from free-form text
- "Extract emergency contact phone numbers from the notes column" - Finds phone numbers mixed with other text
- "Extract manager names from the project notes column" - Pulls out names from descriptions

## Step 3: Review Changes

Chat will show you what changes it's making. Review the suggestions and accept or reject them. You can see before and after values to make sure everything looks correct.

## Step 4: Apply Fixes

Once you're happy with the suggested fixes, accept them. Chat will transform all the data in that column automatically—handling thousands of records at once.

## Example: Cleaning HR Data

If your customer's employee data has messy dates:
1. Open your Employee Data sheet in your Workbook
2. Use Chat and say "Fix date of birth column"
3. Chat uses your Template's date format rules to standardize all dates
4. Review and accept the fixes
5. All dates are now in the correct format

## Example: Extracting Hidden Data

If your construction customer has equipment serial numbers mixed into project notes:
1. Open your Projects sheet
2. Use Chat and say "Extract equipment serial numbers from the project notes column"
3. Chat creates a new column with just the serial numbers
4. Review and accept
5. You now have clean serial numbers in their own column

## Tips

- Chat understands your Templates, so it knows how data should be formatted
- You can fix multiple columns by giving multiple instructions
- Chat works best when you're specific about what you want fixed

## Next Steps

Once your data is clean, you're ready to use it! All validated and cleaned data in your Workbook is ready to import into your system or share with your team.
