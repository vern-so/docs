title: Create an onboarding link for your new customer

  **Recommended:** Set up [Templates](/help-center/key-concepts/curator/templates) before creating your link. Templates define what data you need to collect from your customer and help you validate and clean their data automatically when they submit it.

Creating an onboarding link for your customer takes just a few minutes. Once created, you can send it to them and they can start sharing their data immediately.

## Step 1: Create a Company

<Frame>

</Frame>

Go to [vern.so/companies](https://vern.so/companies) and click "Create Company" or "New Company." Enter your customer's name or company name. This creates a new company record where all their data will be organized.

## Step 2: Get Your Link

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/%23link.png" alt="Links interface" />
</Frame>

As soon as you create the company, Vern automatically generates a unique link for that customer. You'll see the link displayed in your company dashboard. You can copy it with one click.

## Step 3: Share the Link

Send the link to your customer through your preferred channel—email, Slack, your platform, or however you normally communicate with them. They can access it immediately and start sharing their data.

## What Your Customer Can Do

Once your customer has the link, they can:
- Upload CSV files and spreadsheets
- Fill out forms you've created
- Authenticate Scouts to extract data from their existing systems

All their submissions automatically flow into your company dashboard, so you can see everything in one place.

## Next Steps

After your customer starts submitting data, you can:
- [Validate their data](/help-center/quickstart/validating-your-customers-data) using Templates
- [Clean messy data](/help-center/quickstart/cleaning-your-customers-messy-data) using Chat
- [Extract additional data](/help-center/quickstart/extracting-a-file-or-export) from their old systems using Scouts

## Security Tip

You can refresh the link at any time if you need to revoke access or generate a new one. The old link will stop working, keeping your customer's data secure.
