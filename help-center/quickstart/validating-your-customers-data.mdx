title: Validate your customer's uploaded data

Templates help you validate your customer's data automatically. They define what "good" data looks like, so the system can identify problems and suggest fixes.

## Step 1: Create a Template

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/%23template.png" alt="Templates interface" />
</Frame>

Go to [vern.so/templates](https://vern.so/templates) and click "Create template." Upload a CSV file with sample clean data—this could be data from a previous customer or an example of what you expect.

Our AI will automatically analyze your data and generate descriptions and validation rules for each column.

## Step 2: Set Up Validation Rules

Review the generated rules and adjust them as needed. You have three types of rules:

- **AI** - Uses AI to check if values fit the description (flags yellow if something doesn't match)
- **Strict** - Checks against specific patterns or a list of valid values (like approved department names)
- **Link** - Checks if values exist in another Template's column (useful for related data)

For example, if you're validating employee data for HR software, you might set Strict rules for department names (only allow "HR", "Engineering", "Sales", etc.) and AI rules for employee names.

## Step 3: Create a Workbook

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/%23workbook.png" alt="Workbooks interface" />
</Frame>

Go to your Workbooks section and create a new Workbook. Add a sheet for the type of data you're validating (like "Employee Data" or "Project Information").

Assign your Template to the sheet. This tells the system how to validate the data.

## Step 4: Upload Your Customer's Data

You can add data to your Workbook from:
- Your customer's onboarding link
- Manual CSV uploads
- Scout runs or tables

When you upload data, the AI automatically suggests how to map your columns to the Template columns.

## Step 5: Review Validation Results

Once data is uploaded, the system validates everything against your Template rules. You'll see:
- Green checkmarks for valid data
- Yellow flags for data that might need review
- Red flags for invalid data

The system suggests fixes for any problems it finds.

## Step 6: Accept or Reject Fixes

Review each suggested fix and choose to accept or reject it. You have full control—you can accept all fixes, reject specific ones, or make manual adjustments.

## Example: Validating HR Data

If you're onboarding an HR client:
1. Create a Template with rules for Employee ID format, valid departments, and date formats
2. Create a Workbook with an "Employee Data" sheet
3. Upload their employee roster
4. Review validation results and accept fixes
5. Your data is now clean and ready to use
