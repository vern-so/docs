Welcome to Vern! We're here to make it ridiculously easy to extract, validate, and clean your new customer's data.

## Our Mission

At Vern, we understand the challenges you face when onboarding new customers. Getting their data in the right format, validating it, and cleaning it up can be time-consuming and frustrating. That's why we built Vern—to solve this problem once and for all.

Our founders, Roupen and Vish, witnessed this problem firsthand at their old companies. They saw how implementation managers spent countless hours wrestling with messy customer data, and they knew there had to be a better way.
