Runs represent a specific execution instance of a [Task](/essentials/tasks). When you want Vern to perform an action defined by a Task, you create a Run.

## Purpose of Runs

- **Task Execution:** Trigger the actual performance of a defined Task.
- **Input Provision:** Provide the specific data (inputs) required by the Task for this particular execution.
- **Tracking:** Each Run represents a traceable instance of a workflow execution, allowing you to monitor its status and results.

## Creating Runs

Runs can be created via the Vern SDK or REST API. Each run requires a Task ID and can optionally include specific inputs.

### Using the SDK

<SDKExamples taskId="enterInventoryItem"/>

### Using the REST API

```bash
curl -X POST https://vern.so/api/v1/runs \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "taskId": "enterInventoryItem",
    "inputs": {
      // Optional task-specific inputs
    }
  }'
```

**Request Components:**

- `taskId` (required): The ID of the task to execute
- `inputs` (optional): Object containing task-specific input data
- `profileId` (optional): User-specified UID for a profile linked via magic link
- `url` (optional): A URL to be processed by the task

**Response Status Codes:**

<RunStatusCodes />

## Run Lifecycle and Status

<RunLifecycle />

## Retrieving Run Status

You can check the status of a run using the SDK or REST API:

<SDKRetrieveExamples />

The response includes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the run
- `task`: Name of the executed task
- `inputs`: The provided input data
- `status`: Current run status
- `created_at`: When the run was created
- `started_at`: When execution began
- `completed_at`: When execution finished
- `response`: Task execution results (when completed)

## Next Steps

Now that you understand Runs, explore the [Tasks](/essentials/tasks) documentation to learn how to define the actions that your runs will execute. You can also learn about [Webhooks](/essentials/webhooks) to receive notifications when runs complete.
